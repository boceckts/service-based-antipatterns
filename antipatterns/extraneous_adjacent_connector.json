      "consequences": "Using two different types of connectors may cancel the benefit of each one out. Additionally, adaptability and understandability of the service may be reduced.",
      "cause": "May be accidentially introduced by trying to solve another issue. For example, one service received an additional connector to adress another service directly to avoid unnecessary network traffic.",
      "solution": "If a harmonization of protocols and connectors is not possible, one solution is to use an event bus instead of direct access connectors.",
