      "context": "A batch system needs to be integrated into a service-oriented environment. This can e.g. be a legacy application or a system for long running transactions.",

      "consequences": "Solutions avoiding this integration can be expensive and unstable.",
      "cause": "A prejudice exists that integrating batch applications in a service-oriented system is an obsolete technique.",
      "solution": "Implement a classic data store and wrap it as a service. The data store is filled by batch subsystems and used interactively by other services.",
