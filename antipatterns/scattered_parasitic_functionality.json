      "description": "Multiple services are responsible for the same concern and some of these services are also responsible for orthogonal concerns.",
      "context": "That a single concern is splitted among multiple services and that at least one service handles multiple orthogonal concerns violates important service-oriented principles. This means that these concerns infect services with another orthogonal concern, like a parasite.",
      "detection": "",
      "consequences": "Modifiability, reusability, and testability may be reduced. Changing a scattered shared concern requires the changing and testing of several services. The shared concern also cannot be efficiently reused.",
      "cause": "It may be a tempting shortcut to distribute a concern over several existing services.",
      "solution": "Implement a monitoring connector to exchange the data or the status of the data.",
      "example": "Service A has a SharedConcern. Service B and C also have this shared concern, but also an orthogonal concern ConcernB respectively ConcernC. ",
